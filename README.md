Modeling Traffic Patterns in NYC

In this project we decided to work on analyzing traffic trends in NYC and coming up with useful insights. Here you will see a geographic parser using the kml file to split up New York into several socioeconomic regions (13) and then another ipython notebook will compute the shortest path between downtown NYC and the east side of central park (Upper and Lower East Side).
